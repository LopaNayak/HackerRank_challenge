/**inheritance: Overriding rules
 * DEFINE: Overriding refers to the ability of a subclass to re-implement an instance method inherited from a superclass. 
 * Overriding means a scene where two classes in an inheritance relationship, have a method with same/similar
 * signature, the subclass method shadows the implementation of the super class method. 
 * Super class method :: overriden method 
 * Sub class method :: overriding method 
 * *********************************************************************************************************************
 * 1. Which methods? Only inherited methods can be overriden. Therefore, Never Private methods
 * 2. Cannot reduce the visibility of the super class method ## log()
 * 3. CRITERIA 1: The argument list should be exactly the same as that of the overridden method. ##log
 * 4. CRITERIA 2: The return type should be the same or a subtype of the return type declared in 
 *    the original overridden method in the super class.
 * 5. A method declared final cannot be overridden. 
 * 6. A method declared static cannot be overridden but can be re-declared. 
 * 7. The overriding method must not throw new or broader checked exceptions.
 * 8. Constructors and instance initializer blocks cannot be overridden.

	 * Compile time error for reducing the visibility of log method from public to protected
	 * ************************************************************************************
	 * REASON: The reason is, you might want to give an instance of your subclass as an type of 
	 * the superclass to a consumer. This consumer tries to run the (public) method he is used 
	 * to run, since it's public, but you hid it with making it protected. To prevent this, 
	 * this rule is introduced. (the problem is visibility, not static!).**/

	//  Although the static method is redeclared and is not overriding the super class method, it does hide the superclass
	//  method. Hiding is different from overriding. There is a way to access the hidden method but there is no
	//  way to access a overriden super class method.
